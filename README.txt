An auto stop-cast tool for World of Warcraft 1.12.1.5875 (for Windows)

Note that while this makes no malicious changes to the WoW client, it could easily be
mistaken as malicious by the primitive anticheats in use on most vanilla private
servers.  This program contains absolutely no protection against anticheat software.

Feenix / wow-one.com has said that they will not ban people for using it.  Refer to
this thread: http://www.wow-one.com/forum/topic/88974-will-running-this-mod-get-people-banned/

Kronos / Twinstar has said that while they do not support client modification, they
will not specifically target this mod.  Refer to this thread:
